## Description 
Using HTML and CSS I created a 3-page basic portfolio with my picture, bio, projects, and contact page. 

## Requirements
#### 
1. Create a new repository using Github
2. Create 3 HTML documents: 'index.html,''contact.html', and 'portfolio.html'
3. Create an 'assets' folder to hold css and images. Also, style.css and reset.css files.
4. Following the screenshots provided by the instructor, match the layout and designs. Color, fonts, and dimensions for main container and sidebar were given. 
5. Use these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.


## Technologies Used
#### 
- Git
- HTML
- CSS

## Code Explaination
- First, I created all my files and clone them to Github. 
- Then, I created the HTML skeleton that was close to the screenshots, using classes and id's to format everything correctly.I also was sure to link the HTML to all the appropriate pages i.e.   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/reset.css"> where it is linked to the 'reset.css' page 
- After the basic HTML was laid out, I styled them with CSS, following the colors, widths, and fonts provided by the instructor.
- I then found all my images and linked them to my HTML page so that upon clicking them, you would be taken to the site. i.e.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chefjoannabarajas"><img src="assets/images/linkedin2.png"></a>
-Finally, I pushed up my final version to Git and submitted my clone URL to the instructor.
